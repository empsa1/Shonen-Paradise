Shonen Paradise is a mod where we link multiple (tbd more in the future) animes with all its features and lore into one. It will work with a hard dependency on a plugin also being built called Shinobi Way which will add a layer of strategy, battles
  and economy to the server and will also be used with the help of 2 or 3 more plugins like CombatLog and ItemTracker that will be tailored to the mod usage in order to create a smooth environment.
MAIN FOCUSES:
  -Lag free mod
  -Setting up customizable settings to make sure the player can choose, depending on his pc and internet, how the environment looks and behaves.
  -Most anime based mods have alot of cool things to get but all lack actual things to do with them and most of them are to heavy and badly produced to actually be used.
  -Make the mod and the server be reset friendly, meaning, needing to do as few resets as possible when updating mod and when needing balance players.
  -Increase the player skill ceiling, this is also something that the players really miss with the current mods, most of the mods have a very low skill ceiling and a very high grinding floor which can feel underwelming when they can see
    the outcome of so many hours passed grinding to get something real cool that doesnt really make them unique. We want players to feel like they are all different and all have different specialties and playstyles.
Current Landmark:
-Define how to use the abilities and the flow of usage.
-Define how and what skills can be improved and what bonuses the skills give you.
-Define what jutsus to be implemented in the first drop of the mod.
-Define how far we can go with the abilities given the limited server resources.
-Define how to have a balanced economy,a competitive lag-free world and strategy based server.
